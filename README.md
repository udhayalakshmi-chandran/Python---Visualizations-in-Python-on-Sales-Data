# Python---Visualizations-in-Python-on-Sales-Data
Data visualization is a general term that describes any effort to help people understand the 
significance of data by placing it in a visual context. Patterns, trends and correlations that 
might go undetected in text-based data can be exposed and recognized easier with data 
visualization software.
It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult 
concepts or identify new patterns. 
The objective of this dashboard is to understand sales trends for one of the leading 
pharmaceutical company. 
The client would like to come see a dynamic dashboard with different KPI's at different 
levels (National, Region & Territory etc). Create the below charts as these would help us 
explore the past data in a better manner and give a good picture of the progress and 
failures. This in turn would catalyse the decision-making process, making it easier, simpler 
and accurate.
